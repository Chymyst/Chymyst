# `Chymyst` - Declarative concurrency in Scala

The `Chymyst` project is an application framework and library for developing general concurrent applications in Scala.

This project uses the [`Chymyst Core`](https://chymyst.github.io/joinrun-scala/) library, which implements the **chemical machine** paradigm of concurrency.
